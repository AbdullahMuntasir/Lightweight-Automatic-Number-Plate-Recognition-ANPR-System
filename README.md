# Lightweight-Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition-ANPR-System
A lightweight ANPR system was developed using classical image processing and OCR techniques to detect and recognize vehicle number plates. The system applies preprocessing, edge detection, contour analysis, and OCR with a fallback mechanism to ensure reliable performance under normal conditions.
