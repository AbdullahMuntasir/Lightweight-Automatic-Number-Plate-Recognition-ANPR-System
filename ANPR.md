# Lightweight-Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition-ANPR-System

This project presents the design and implementation of a lightweight Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using classical digital image processing techniques and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The system takes a vehicle image as input and processes it through grayscale conversion, noise reduction using a bilateral filter, edge detection with the Canny operator, and contour analysis to localize the number plate region. Once the plate area is detected and cropped, alphanumeric characters are extracted using EasyOCR and converted to uppercase for consistency.

A fallback strategy is incorporated to apply OCR directly on the full image when contour-based plate detection fails, improving robustness under challenging conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can accurately detect and recognize number plates under normal lighting and background conditions while maintaining low computational complexity. Although performance degrades for low-light images, blurred plates, rotated plates, and complex backgrounds, the system remains efficient and suitable for applications such as parking management, traffic monitoring, and access control, with clear scope for future enhancements through advanced preprocessing and deep-learning-based methods.
